// The modern mode, "use strict"

// When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

// No compatibility issues

// There is no directive like "no use strict" that reverts the engine to old behavior.
// Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back.


// Browser console

// Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures , that enable use strict automatically
